# Noughts and Crosses Game 
## Coursework for ALGORITHMS and DATA STRUCTURES class SET 08122
## noughts_and_crosses.c

### INTRODUCTION
This purpose of this coursework was to design and implement a noughts and crosses game written in the C programming language. I worked on designing both a PLAYER vs PLAYER mode of the game and a PLAYER vs COMPUTER mode. Looking to save the inputted commands in Array of different data types so they could be utilised at different areas of the code to achieve different outcomes. (ie, knowing when a row of 3 matching symbols had been reached so that a winner could be declared)

### DESIGN
* #### Undo and Redo behaviour during game play

### ENHANCEMENTS 
A struct data structure set up to run as a Stack stored in persistent memory on the heap using malloc
Each move pushed onto the stack then popped off would create the undo behaviour.

* #### Earlier games to be automatically replayed from memory

Queue
Moves stored in persistent memory on the heap using malloc
