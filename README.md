## instructions for compiling and playing the noughts and crosses game
A make file is included for this program so to initiate the noughts and crosses game navigate to the correct directory where the files are stored and type in 'nmake game' to compile the code to create the executable file and run the program.

You will then be prompted as to whether you want to play a 2 or 1 player game-
** 2 player game ** is where you and a friend take alternate turns to complete the game one nought and cross at a time.
