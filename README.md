## instructions for compiling and playing the noughts and crosses game
A make file is included for this program. 

To initiate the noughts and crosses game open the command prompt window and navigate to the correct directory where the files are stored and type in 'nmake game' to compile the code to create the executable file and run the program.

You will then be prompted as to whether you want to play a **2** **or** **1** **player** **game**:

**2 player game** is where you and a friend take alternate turns to complete the game one nought and cross at a time.

**1 player game** is where you play against the computer with alternate shots 

You will then be prompted as to whether you wish to play the game as a nought, **0** or as a cross **X**. The decision is up to you, but you will always have the first shot when playing in the PLAYER vs COMPUTER mode.

You will proceed to play in an alternate fashion until either all 9 slots of the game board are full or the game detects a row of either 3 noughts or crosses, **horizontally**, **vertically** or **diagonally**, at which point the game will also terminate and either the Noughts or Crosses will be declared the **WINNER**.
